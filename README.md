# tunnel
This is a tunnel application made to expose your local development environment to the internet, similar to ngrok. It includes both server and client code. You can use this setup with your own server to expose your team's development applications to the internet for testing purposes.

In this repository, we include both the server and client code.

# Server Setup:
Run the server code on a publicly accessible server, such as any cloud provider's server. This server will handle incoming traffic and forward it to your local development environment.

# Client Setup:
Run the client code on your local machine. This code will establish a connection to the server and create a secure tunnel, making your local application accessible over the internet.

By using this setup, your team members can easily share their local development work with others for testing and collaboration.
